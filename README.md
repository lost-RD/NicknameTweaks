# NicknameTweaks (requires CCL)
RimWorld mod

Nicknames max length upped from 15 to 27. Adds a short tag to the end of the nickname comprised of two parts. First part is S/B/NV which stand for shooter, brawler and non-violent. Second part is H/NH which stands for hauler and non-hauler. Example tags: SH (shooter hauler), NVNH (non-violent non-hauler i.e. cannon fodder).
